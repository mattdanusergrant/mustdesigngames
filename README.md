# Must Design Games

A single home for Matt Danuser-Grant's playable game prototypes. One repo, one
GitHub Pages site, **one folder per game** — each a self-contained static build
served at its own sub-path.

**Live:** https://mattdanusergrant.github.io/mustdesigngames/

## Add a new prototype

1. Drop a self-contained folder at the repo root: `my-game/index.html` (+ any
   assets, using **relative** paths so it works under the sub-path).
2. Add a card to the gallery in the root `index.html`.
3. Commit to `main` — the Pages workflow deploys the whole repo automatically.

## How it deploys

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` publishes the repo root to GitHub Pages on every
push to `main`. `.nojekyll` tells Pages to serve files verbatim (no Jekyll).
Static content only — most games are vanilla HTML/JS/Canvas; the 3D entry
(Grand Theft Apples) uses WebGL via a vendored, self-contained Three.js build.
